## move discs from one tower to the next
<img src= "hanoitower.png" width='600'/>

This page will recreate the classic riddle of Vietnamese monks who were asked to move 64 discs, stacked by decreasing size, from one tower to the next, using a third tower as a staging area. The discs can only be moved one at a time, and a disc can only be placed on top of a larger disc or nothing at all, never on top of a smaller disc. 

In this version, the user can input the number of discs, and if nothing is input, then it will default to 5 discs. The user can then move the discs one by one by clicking the "Make Move" button. 

Please note: the number of moves required to complete the exercise will double plus one for each additional disc added to the stack. Do not input 64 discs, or you may grow old and die before you are finished clicking them through.
